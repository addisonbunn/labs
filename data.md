Let's explore: [UNC's Federal Writer's Project](http://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/03709/)

Take a look at the following:

1. [Folder 1: Barnard, George S. (interviewer): A Negro Cook's Day](http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/03709/id/1004)

2. [280.xml](https://github.com/introdh2016/labs/blob/master/280.xml)

And ask:

* Which distinctions apply to each of these (as outlined by Christof Schoch in "Big? Smart? Clean? Messy? Data in the Humanities")?
  * structured, semi-structured, unstructured?
  * data? metadata?
  * clean? messy? tidy?
  * Big data? Smart data?  If not, how might we make it big and/or smart data?

Let's turn [Folder 1: Barnard, George S. (interviewer): A Negro Cook's Day](http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/03709/id/1004) into tidy data. 

In your group, develop a database that represents data about each interview using the methodology of tidy data. 
Fill in at least two interviews in your database. 
To do this, you can either:

* Use Markdown in Github. Create a new file in funwithMD repository. Click on "raw" to see how.

* The group can create a google sheet and share the link with me. I'll put the link here: YOURLINK
