Let's explore: [UNC's Federal Writer's Project](http://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/03709/)

Take a look at the following:

1. [Folder 1: Barnard, George S. (interviewer): A Negro Cook's Day](http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/03709/id/1004)

2. [280.xml](https://github.com/introdh2016/labs/blob/master/280.xml)

And ask:

* Which distinctions apply to each of these (as outlined by Christof Schoch in "Big? Smart? Clean? Messy? Data in the Humanities")?
  * structured, semi-structured, unstructured?
  * data? metadata?
  * clean? messy?
  * Big data? Smart data?  If not, how might we make it big and/or smart data?
